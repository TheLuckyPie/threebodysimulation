# Three Body Python Simulation
A Python-based three-body-simulation which also produces matplotlib-based 3d animations.

Uses the following packages:
- Scipy
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- datetime

Running the code produces a three-body simulation with a duration of 1 minute with random intial conditions for all three bodies (for mass, initial position, and initial velocity vectors). (If you do run it, prepare to wait around 5 minutes for the simulation and the animated plot to save as an mp4)

Two examples of the mp4 produced (We can notice that both end with an ejection of a single body and a binary system, and infact this is common for all such three-body systems):
